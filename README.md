I followed these steps to publish a simple HTML page for a knowledge graph:

1. Converted the knowledge graph turtle file into HTML using https://www.online-convert.com/.
2. I uploaded the HTML file to GitHub and named it index.html.
3. Finally, I published the page on GitHub Pages from the root directory of my repository.
The knowledge graph is online at https://naeima.github.io/fooKG/
