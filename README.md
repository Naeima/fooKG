I followed these steps to publish a simple HTML page for a knowledge graph:

I converted the knowledge graph turtle file into an HTML format.
I uploaded the HTML file to GitHub and named it index.html.
I created a _config.yml file and included the "Themes: minima" setting.
Finally, I published the page on GitHub Pages from the root directory of my repository."
