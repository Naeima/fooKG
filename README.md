I followed these steps to publish a simple HTML page for a knowledge graph:

1. Converted the knowledge graph turtle file into an HTML format.
2. Uploaded the HTML file to GitHub and named it index.html.
3. Created a _config.yml file and included the "Themes: minima" setting.
4. Finally, I published the page on GitHub Pages from the root directory of my repository."
